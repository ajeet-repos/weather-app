In this tutorial, we'll focus on how to integrate APIs to fetch data and handling that data efficiently using the GetX library.
Throughout this post, we'll cover the following topics:
Setting up a Flutter project and installing necessary dependencies
Integrating with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data
Parsing JSON responses and handling errors
Using GetX for state management and dependency injection
Implementing a clean and organized project structure
Building the user interface for the home screen, location search screen, and about screen
Navigating between screens using GetX navigation

We'll concentrate on the core functionality of fetching and managing data from server/backend.
By the end, you'll have a fully functional weather app that demonstrates best practices in Flutter development, including API integration, state management, and code organization.
